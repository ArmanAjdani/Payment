FaultResiliant:
  1. Using a master-slave structure for DB clusters to manage load and avoid data loss.
  2. In sync requests implement the Retry mechanism to make sure no loss request happens.
Security:
  1. All sensitive data, such as credit cards, should be secure using Encryption and masked to avoid abuses. Sensitive DBs should all have restricted access and change credentials frequently to avoid long-term data access.
